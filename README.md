## Project Objective
As a small business owner I want to be able to write and save notes
so that I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete.


## Acceptance Criteria
Given a note-taking application

1) When I open the Note Taker
then I am presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page.
2) When I click on the link to the notes page
then I am presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
3) When I enter a new note title and the note’s text
then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
4) When I click on the Save icon
then the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
5) When I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
then that note appears in the right-hand column.
6) When I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
then I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
